# multi-track-listening

A quirky audio mixing experiment that uses the awesome new [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) React framework. Mix two tracks together using 3D spatialization for some... interesting results.

It's not a real website right now but if you're curious you can check out a demo deployment at [https://multi-track-listening-yxiiqicsqv.now.sh](https://multi-track-listening-yxiiqicsqv.now.sh).
